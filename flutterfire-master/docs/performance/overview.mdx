## Installation

<Tabs
groupId="legacy-or-nullsafe"
defaultValue="legacy"
values={[
    { label: "Legacy", value: "legacy" },
    { label: "Null safety", value: "null-safe" },
]}
>
<TabItem value="legacy">
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="null-safe">

:::caution
This package version is not null safe migrated yet, but has been implemented to be compatible with other null safe FlutterFire packages.
:::

Ensure you're using the Flutter `stable` channel:

```bash
$ flutter channel stable
```

If your app is mixing legacy and null-safe packages, use the `--no-sound-null-safety` flag:
```bash
$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

For legacy package imports, place the following ignore comment to hide Dart analyzer warnings:

```dart
// ignore: import_of_legacy_library_into_null_safe
import 'package:firebase_performance/firebase_performance.dart';
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
