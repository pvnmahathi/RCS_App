##  What does it do?

App Check helps protect your backend resources (such as Cloud Storage) from
abuse (such as billing fraud or phishing).

With App Check, devices running your app will use an app identity attestation
provider to certify it is indeed your authentic app, and may also check that itâ€™s
running on an authentic, untampered device. This certification is attached to every
request your app makes to your Firebase backend resources.

App Check currently supports Cloud Storage, Realtime Database, and Cloud
Functions, with more Firebase products coming soon.

Note: App Check may not protect against certain abuse vectors when paired
with a CDN.

## Installation

:::caution
FlutterFire App Check is an early access preview plugin; APIs may change in a future release.
:::

Ensure you're using the Flutter `stable` channel:

```bash
$ flutter channel stable
```

If your app is mixing legacy and null-safe packages, use the `--no-sound-null-safety` flag:
```bash
$ flutter run --no-sound-null-safety
```

For legacy package imports, place the following ignore comment to hide Dart analyzer warnings:

```dart
import 'package:firebase_app_check/firebase_app_check.dart';
```

### 1. Add dependency

Add the [`firebase_app_check`](https://pub.dev/packages/firebase_app_check) dependency to your projects `pubspec.yaml` file:


```yaml {5} title="pubspec.yaml"
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  firebase_core: "^{{ plugins.firebase_core_ns }}"
  firebase_app_check: "^{{ plugins.firebase_app_check_ns }}"
```

### 2. Download dependency

```
$ flutter pub get
```

### 3. (Web Only) Add the SDK

If using FlutterFire on the web, add the `firebase-app-check` JavaScript SDK to your `index.html` file:

```html {5} title="web/index.html"
<html>
  ...
  <body>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-app.js"></script>
    <script src="https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/{{ web.firebase_cdn }}/firebase-app-check.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 4. Rebuild your app

Once complete, rebuild your Flutter application:

```bash
$ flutter run
```
